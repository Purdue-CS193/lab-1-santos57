# Dean's first CS193 Lab

- It's a relaxed class that still has useful information about the tools we'll be using
- The TAs/instructors are nice
- These monitors are pretty great... Nice and wide
- The lighting in this room is yellow, which I guess is better than no lighting or a blue tint
- The blinds on the front window are half open, and from my seat it like perfectly frames a stoplight outside. It's like my personal art piece. To me it represents society and the folly of man.



## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling my writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I have selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
